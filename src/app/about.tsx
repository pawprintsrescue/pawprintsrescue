      <p className="mb-4">
        <b>Paw Prints Animal Rescue (PPAR)</b> is an all-volunteer nonprofit
        organization dedicated to reducing the population of homeless cats,
        kittens, dogs and puppies by maintaining two programs -- a Rescue and
        Adoption Program and a Feral Cat Management Program. Individual
        donations are our most important source of income as we receive no
        public funding.
      </p>
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">Rescue and Adoption Program</h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        We are dedicated to finding forever homes for displaced or abandoned
        dogs and cats and educating the public about pet over population and the
        benefits of spaying and neutering. Paw Prints accepts into its Rescue
        and Adoption Program stray cats, kittens, dogs and puppies from the
        general public as foster space permits.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-4">
        Prior to adoption, foster animals are tested, vaccinated, microchipped,
        treated for various parasites, and sterilized (if age appropriate). They
        receive individualized love, socialization, training and observation in
        their foster homes to ensure that a perfect match is achieved when
        adopted into their forever homes. These cats and dogs live in volunteer
        foster homes until we find them a loving permanent home, however long it
        takes. Paw Prints makes a lifetime commitment to each animal it rescues
        and places through adoption. We never want these animals to be homeless
        again. Accordingly, our adoption contract requires any individual who
        adopts an animal from our program to return it to us for re-homing
        should they ever find, for any reason, they are no longer able to
        provide it with a home. In addition, we are committed to doing all we
        can to stem the tide of homeless animals by requiring that all animals
        adopted from our program be sterilized.

        Feral Cat Colony Management Program
      </h2>
      <p className="mb-4">
        In addition to its Rescue and Adoption Program, Paw Prints assists
        citizens maintain several feral cat colonies in the Triangle area.
        Maintenance of a colony includes providing daily food and water,
        building and maintaining shelters, sterilizing and vaccinating the cats,
        and providing veterinary care for conditions such as abscesses,
        respiratory infections, mouth and gum disease. Where possible, Paw
        Prints helps secure donated or low-cost cat food and veterinary services
        to assist caretakers. Paw Prints also offers advice and assistance to
        individuals and other groups with respect to non-lethal feral cat
        management. Friendly cats and kittens are often discovered living in
        feral cat colonies. A large percentage of young kittens in a colony can
        be tamed with proper handling and attention. Friendly adult cats are
        occasionally identified; more often than not, recently abandoned at or
        near the colony. When foster space permits, these friendly cats and
        kittens are pulled from their colonies to enter Paw Prints&apos; Rescue
        and Adoption Program.
